# disasterresponse
It is important to analyse messages sent during disaster events to let relief mechanisms get in action as soon as possible. This repository contains the code for the analysis of such messages using ML techniques for a classification in different categories, so that they can be forwarded fast to the right authority. The whole approach can be applied as a web application.
